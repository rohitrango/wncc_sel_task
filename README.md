# wncc_sel_task
<h2>Tasks assigned for WnCC selection </h2>

Both the assignments have been made for my own experience and satisfaction. You may feel free to view both of them. <br>
But for screening purposes, I recommend you to watch the first one (in the folder named googleapis). Run the distances.py from terminal with a file "input.txt" in the same directory. <br>
The user will be prompted to write a file name which will be used to store the results in the file. <br> 
Code is well-documented (I guess), feel free to add features to it. <br>
