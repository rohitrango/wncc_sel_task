# wncc_sel_task
Tasks assigned for WnCC selection 

Both the assignments have been made for my own experience and satisfaction. You may feel free to view both of them. 
But for screening purposes, I recommend you to watch the first one (in the folder named googleapis). Run the distances.py from terminal with a file "input.txt" in the same directory.
The user will be prompted to write a file name which will be used to store the results in the file. 
Code is well-documented (I guess), feel free to add features to it.
